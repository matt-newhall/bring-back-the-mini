# Bring Back the Mini

Google Chrome extension to make the NY Times Mini playable again by bypassing the paywall. Just kinda hacking in the functionality currently.

## Installation

Still pending adding this to the store, if at all. For now, do the following:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Load in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select this repository folder

After making changes, refresh the extension in `chrome://extensions`.
